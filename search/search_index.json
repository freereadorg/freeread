IPFS is a de-centralized file and webhosting protocol founded on ideals of freedom and openness. The Library Genesis collection is live on IPFS as of today, accessible via libgen.rs and libgen.fun . IPFS is like BitTorrent but has a single global swarm, and it's accessible on the web. You can learn about the IPFS project from IPFS.io or Wikipedia . IPFS is the next technical revolution in peer-to-peer networking, allowing people like you to share books with readers who request them. IPFS is the next best weapon in the fight against domain take-downs and internet censorship. We can now each become a founding shelf for a free, global library. Let's start. Get started IPFS is simple. Hosts (you) Pin files (books) using Content Identifiers (CID Hashes) to share them on the IPFS network. CID Hashes can represent individual files or an entire folder. Pinning saves the files to your local computer so you can share them, and others can Pin them from you. Each CID Hash for Library Genesis represents 1,000 books, or about 5 gigabytes of local file storage. 100 pins = 100,000 books! Who ever told you that you couldn't start your own library? Copyright warning Before you begin, make sure you understand the legal implications of hosting and sharing copyrighted material. Installing IPFS Are you a power-user or run a server? Jump to the section on getting started with Docker. If you're not, just install the IPFS Desktop client . Make sure to read the desktop system requirements.

The most reliable way to find books is to search for the ISBN. You can find the ISBN on a book's Amazon product page. If that doesn't work, try the author's last name and a word from the title. Once you have your results, click the \"Language\" column to sort by Language. To get your book, click on one of the 5 mirror links provided. Library Genesis (LibGen) is down for me. Visit the mirrors . If your country has blocked/banned access to the mirrors, use a free VPN like ProtonVPN . Do I need to use a VPN to access Library Genesis (LibGen)? Unless you live in a country without freedom of speech, where reading certain books is banned, then there is no reason to use a VPN. But if you can't access LibGen because it is blocked/banned in your country, then a VPN will unlock access. Will I get in trouble with my internet provider (ISP) or copyright lawyers if I download books from Library Genesis (LibGen)? No case exists of someone being sued for downloading a copyrighted book, song, or movie from a website. Downloading from LibGen's website isn't filesharing (P2P), so copyright holders can't find out who is downloading from LibGen, and they wouldn't care if they knew. The owners of LibGen and Sci-Hub are the real targets of the (unsuccessful) lawsuits because they distribute the pirated content, not the users. Thousands of students and scientists around the world safely visit LibGen every day, so you're in good company. Can I get viruses or malware from books downloaded from Library Genesis (LibGen)? Visiting the LibGen websites is safe, and they are maintained by volunteer librarians who love reading as much as you. All book files are also scanned for viruses by the librarians. Book files like EPUBs and PDFs are also not a real risk because they are not EXE files (viruses are usually EXE files).
