You can learn more about the IPFS project from IPFS.io or Wikipedia . Library Genesis servers have been backed by peer-to-peer distributions like BitTorrent and eDonkey for many years. IPFS is the next technical revolution in peer-to-peer, allowing people like you to share books with readers who request them. IPFS is our best weapon in the fight against domain take-downs and internet censorship. We can each become a founding shelf for a free, global library. Get started IPFS is simple. Hosts (you) Pin files (books) using Content Identifiers (CID Hashes) to share them on the IPFS network. CID Hashes can represent individual files or an entire folder. Pinning saves the files to your local computer so you can share them, and others can Pin them from you. Each CID Hash for Library Genesis represents 1,000 books, or about 5 gigabytes of local file storage. 100 pins = 100,000 books! Who ever told you that you couldn't start your own library? Copyright warning Before you begin, make sure you understand the legal implications of hosting and sharing copyrighted material. Installing IPFS Are you a power-user or run a server? Jump to the section on getting started with Docker. If you're not, just install the IPFS Desktop client . Make sure to read the desktop system requirements. Desktop client System requirements Note that IPFS Desktop client is an alpha-stage software still in development. The command line version of the software for servers/home servers is more mature. Requires internet serice provider with unlimited bandwidth. Do not install IPFS if you have a monthly bandwidth or data cap. Recommended at least 16GB RAM and Intel i5 or equivalent processor Recommended at least 100 mbps, gigabit connection preferred Recommended port forwarding Get started Pin your first CID Hash Click Files > Import > From IPFS Then copy and paste in your first CID Hash containing 1,000 books (about 6GB).

Follow these steps then jump to torrents . System requirements Docker ( docker.com/get-docker ) Requires internet serice provider with unlimited bandwidth. Do not install IPFS if you have a monthly bandwidth or data cap. Requires between 10GB or more of hard-drive space. For more information refer to the CID Hash index with file sizes.
