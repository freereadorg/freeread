IPFS is a de-centralized file and webhosting protocol founded on ideals of freedom and openness. The Library Genesis collection is live on IPFS as of today, accessible via libgen.rs and libgen.fun . IPFS is like BitTorrent but has a single global swarm, and it's accessible on the web. You can learn about the IPFS project from IPFS.io or Wikipedia . IPFS is the next technical revolution in peer-to-peer networking, allowing people like you to share books with readers who request them. IPFS is the next best weapon in the fight against domain take-downs and internet censorship. We can now each become a founding shelf for a free, global library. Let's start. Get started IPFS is simple. Hosts (you) Pin files (books) using Content Identifiers (CID Hashes) to share them on the IPFS network. CID Hashes can represent individual files or an entire folder. Pinning saves the files to your local computer so you can share them, and others can Pin them from you. Each CID Hash for Library Genesis represents 1,000 books, or about 5 gigabytes of local file storage. 100 pins = 100,000 books! Who ever told you that you couldn't start your own library?

I can't access it. Usually it's because your government has banned access. Solution 1 Enable DNS over HTTPS to override your country's censorship over the internet. Solution 2 Install a free VPN or download the Tor Browser to access websites your government has banned. Solution 3 Request books or articles using the Nexus Search Telegram bot . \u25ba General questions How do I find books on Library Genesis (LibGen)? The most reliable way to find books is to search for the ISBN. You can find the ISBN on a book's Amazon product page. If that doesn't work, try the author's last name and a word from the title. Once you have your results, click the \"Language\" column to sort by Language. To get your book, click on one of the 5 mirror links provided. Library Genesis (LibGen) is down for me. Visit the mirrors listed on the subreddit dropdown menu or sidebar. If your country has blocked/banned access to the mirrors, use a free VPN like ProtonVPN or Enable DNS over HTTPS . Do I need to use a VPN to access Library Genesis (LibGen)? Unless you live in a country without freedom of speech, where reading certain books is banned, then there is no reason to use a VPN. But if you can't access LibGen because it is blocked/banned in your country, then a VPN will unlock access. Will I get in trouble with my internet provider (ISP) or copyright lawyers if I download books from Library Genesis (LibGen)? No case exists of someone being sued for downloading a copyrighted book, song, or movie from a website. Downloading from LibGen's website isn't filesharing (P2P), so copyright holders can't find out who is downloading from LibGen, and they wouldn't care if they knew. The owners of LibGen and Sci-Hub are the real targets of the (unsuccessful) lawsuits because they distribute the pirated content, not the users. Thousands of students and scientists around the world safely visit LibGen every day, so you're in good company. Can I get viruses or malware from books downloaded from Library Genesis (LibGen)? Visiting the LibGen websites is safe, and they are maintained by volunteer librarians who love reading as much as you. All book files are also scanned for viruses by the librarians. Book files like EPUBs and PDFs are also not a real risk because they are not EXE files (viruses are usually EXE files). Opening the books with readers like Adobe Acrobat or Chrome/Edge will also protect you with their built-in security. An additional and unnecessary precaution you can take is to scan book files using VirusTotal.com . I downloaded an EPUB file. How do I open or read EPUB files? Calibre-eBook.com . Also see alternativeto.net 's recommendations for other EPUB readers. I have so many books. What is the best software to manage my book collection? Calibre-eBook.com . Also see alternativeto.net 's recommendations for other e-book libraries. \u25ba Giving and donating How do I upload my books or contribute material to the library? Visit the Library Genesis MHUT forums for login credentials and further instructions for uploading. How can I help seed the Library Genesis (LibGen) torrents? You can join the Library Genesis Seeding Project to help seed the torrents that serve to preserve and archive the 2.5-million books in the library collection. PhillM's LibGen torrent index tracks which torrents need seeders, start there. How do the torrents work? There are roughly 2,400 torrents in total and each torrent contains 1,000 books (2.4 million books). Each book file is named by its MD5 hash string. The SQL database files contain the file extension, book names, authors, and all other meta information. The book files and SQL databases together make up the library, so distributing copies of these files means anyone in the world can create a copy of Library Genesis. \u25ba Accessing the library and finding books Why can't I find ___ on Library Genesis (LibGen)? Where can I find ____ if it's not there? Looking for newspaper articles, non-scientific papers, old books, rare books, technical standards? LibGen doesn't have everything. Here are some tips for finding books and articles that you can't find on LibGen: Get your ISBN(s) or DOI(s) identifiers first. These are the identity of books and articles. Books can have multiple ISBNs associated with them. Search the LibGen mirrors (or scihub) for your identifier.

Legal Notice: USDOJ and Elsevier really don't like their proxy, for good reason, so I recommend against working on anything like that, but instead play with the open (and legal) database of DOIs. A database of metadata is legal and not in clear violation of IP law ( IANAL ). Sci-Hub Torrents: The Rescue Mission scimag-archive torrents work like this: ./DOI, that's it. Sci-Hub API: A live API implementation of Sci-Hub can be seen in the Zotero plugin, see ethanwillis/zotero-scihub , it's just a URL + DOI + optional captcha. That's the whole damn API. Sci-Hub Database: Sci-Hub's database is available here: libgen.rs/dbdump and database documentation is available here: lucidhack/knowl Some examples of big brain problems to solve: How to legally ingest new papers from authors and load them onto the existing SQL database? How to make use of de-centralized solutions like WebTorrent and IPFS to deliver papers? How to extract good metadata from scientific PDFs?

You can join the Library Genesis Seeding Project to help seed the torrents that serve to preserve and archive the 2.5-million books in the library collection. PhillM's LibGen torrent index tracks which torrents need seeders, start there. How do the torrents work? The torrents are divided into three collections: scitech, fiction, and scimag. The book files and SQL databases together make up the library, so distributing these torrents means anyone in the world can create a mirror of Library Genesis. The SQL database files contain the file extension, book names, authors, and all other meta information. scitech spans 3 million books packaged into 2,400+ torrents, with each torrent containing 1,000 books. Each scitech book file is named for its MD5 hash string. fiction spans 2.4 million books packaged into 1,000 torrents, with each torrent containing 1,000 books. Each fiction book file is named for its MD5 hash string. Fiction SQL databases are divided into Russian and Foreign language (i.e. all languages other than Russian). scimag spans 85 million scientific articles packaged into 850+ torrents, with each torrent containing 100 zip files. Each scientific article is named for its DOI. How do the SQL databases work? You can download the SQL databases from https://lgdumps.xyz/dumps/ .
